# SoulGem
I thought it would be fun to 3d print a little glow in the dark bobble (Soul Gem from Skyrim in my case) and charge it periodically with a UV LED, but only when it's dark.

## Credits
Watchdog timer code modified from Alex at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob5fHhPDqvU (2 part video, details in the second video) which goes int some greate detail on how this works!

## Parts
1. 3d printed bobble (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2046986)
2. ATTiny85 (and Avr Programmer)
3. Photoresistor (not sure if my is 4.7kohm.... it came in an arduino kit)
4. UV LED
5. 10k resistor
6. ~3v power (CR2032)
7. (optional) if you go with a higher voltage power supply, you'll need an appropriate resistor for the LED.
